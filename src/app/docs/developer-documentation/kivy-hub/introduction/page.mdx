# Introduction to Kivy Hub Development

Kivy Hub is one of the main parts of the Kivy ecosystem. It is specifically built to make it as easy as possible to extend with new components and functionality, not only by us, the developer team, but also the community.

This part of the documentation describes how the core of Kivy Hub works. The main parts of Kivy Hub are:

1. The interaction system

2. Core components (used to build widgets)

3. Built-in components
