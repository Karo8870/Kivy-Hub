# Input Context

To have access to the different data provided by the user within code, Kivy Hub provides a general hook called `useHandTracking`. It provides multiple functions and sub hooks for almost all use cases.

## Importing

```ts
import { useHandTracking } from 'kivy-hub/core';
```

## Accessing the MediaPipe Hand tracking Model

You can access the MediaPipe model through the `handTracker` property:

```ts
const { handTracker } = useHandTracking();
```

## Getting the MediaPipe Model Status

You can access the MediaPipe model through the `modelStatus` property:

```ts
const { modelStatus } = useHandTracking();
```

## Toggling Tracking and Hand Input

The `toggleTracking` function provides an easy way to completely turn on / off the tracking performed by MediaPipe, completely disabling all input through hands:

```ts
const { toggleTracking } = useHandTracking();

toggleTracking();
```

## Accessing Raw MediaPipe Data

You can access raw MediaPipe data (the list of hands and landmarks) as a list of numbers directly through a `RefObject` called `rawLandMarksRef`:

```ts
const { rawLandmarksRef } = useHandTracking();
```

The raw landmarks are in three dimensions and have the following type:

```ts
import { RefObject } from 'react';
interface NormalizedLandmark {
  x: number;
  y: number;
  z: number;
  visibility?: number;
}

type RawLandmarks = NormalizedLandmark[][];

type RawLandmarksRef = RefObject<RawLandmarks>;
```

## Accessing Parsed Hand Data

The parsed landmarks can be accessed as a `RefObject` called landmarksRef which is a list ofHandLandMarks:

```ts
const { landmarksRef } = useHandTracking();
```

```ts
type LandmarkPoint = {
  x: number;
  y: number;
};

interface HandLandmarks {
  wrist: LandmarkPoint;
  thumb: {
    cmc: LandmarkPoint;
    mcp: LandmarkPoint;
    ip: LandmarkPoint;
    tip: LandmarkPoint;
  };
  index: {
    mcp: LandmarkPoint;
    pip: LandmarkPoint;
    dip: LandmarkPoint;
    tip: LandmarkPoint;
  };
  middle: {
    mcp: LandmarkPoint;
    pip: LandmarkPoint;
    dip: LandmarkPoint;
    tip: LandmarkPoint;
  };
  ring: {
    mcp: LandmarkPoint;
    pip: LandmarkPoint;
    dip: LandmarkPoint;
    tip: LandmarkPoint;
  };
  pinky: {
    mcp: LandmarkPoint;
    pip: LandmarkPoint;
    dip: LandmarkPoint;
    tip: LandmarkPoint;
  };
}
```

## Getting Current Hand Event Touch Type

The touch type for all available hands can be accessed through the `handEventsRef` property which is a `RefObject`. It represents a list of HandEvent elements:

```ts
enum HandEvent {
  NO_TOUCH = -1,
  PRIMARY_TOUCH,
  SECONDARY_TOUCH,
  TERTIARY_TOUCH
}
```

```ts
const { handEventsRef } = useHandTracking();
```

## Getting Video Input

To get video input from the camera, you can use the `videoRef` prop:

```ts
const { videoRef } = useHandTracking();
```

## Accessing the Event Registry

You can access the [event registry](/docs/developer-documentation/kivy-hub/interaction/event-system#global-event-registry) through the `eventRegistryRef`.

```ts
const { eventRegistryRef } = useHandTracking();
```

## Getting the Mouse Position for the Web Interface

Usually, to access the mouse position in a web environment you have to register a window event with mousemove and keep track of the mouse position yourself. Kivy provides a reference to the mouse position that can be accessed through the `mousePositionRef` prop:

```ts
const { mousePositionRef } = useHandTracking();
```

## Check If Tracking Is Running

You can check if the tracking process is running through the `isTracking` prop:

```ts
const { isTracking } = useHandTracking();
```

## Check If the Camera Is On

You can check if the camera is running through the `webcamRunning` prop:

```ts
const { webcamRunning } = useHandTracking();
```
