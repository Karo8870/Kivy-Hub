# System Requirements

## Mobile Application

To run the Kivy mobile app, users need a compatible Apple device with the following minimum system requirements:

- **Supported devices**: iPhone, iPad, Apple Vision Pro, or Mac (Apple Silicon or Intel-based)
- **Operating systems**:
- iOS 18.0 or later
- iPadOS 18.0 or later
- visionOS 2.0 or later
- macOS 15.0 or later (for Catalyst compatibility)
- **Connectivity**: An active internet connection is required for accessing online features such as syncing data, retrieving personalized recommendations, and performing AI-based operations.
- **Storage**: Minimum of 100 MB of free disk space.
- **Permissions**:
- **Camera access** (used for scanning ingredients, recognizing gestures, or using the visual meal tracker)
- **Health data access** (used to personalize nutrition and activity tracking via HealthKit)

> The app is optimized for Apple devices only and is distributed via the App Store or TestFlight during the development phase.

## Web Application

The Kivy web interface is lightweight and designed to run smoothly on any modern device with minimal system requirements. It is fully responsive and accessible from desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

- **CPU usage**: Very low, as the site primarily serves static assets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- **RAM usage**: Typically under **150 MB** in modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- **Compatibility**: Fully functional on any browser that supports ES6, CSS Grid/Flexbox, and modern DOM APIs
- **Performance**: The application is optimized for fast loading times, with minimal impact on device performance, even on older systems with limited resources

> Ideal for quick access to recipes, educational resources, and managing your Kivy Hub remotely.

## Hardware Component (Kivy Hub) – Software Interface

For running the software that controls the hardware component (Kivy Hub) via a browser-based or desktop interface, the following setup is recommended to ensure optimal performance:

- **CPU**: Quad-core or better (Intel i5 / Apple M1 / AMD Ryzen equivalent)
- **RAM**: Minimum **4 GB** (8 GB or more recommended for heavy usage)
- **GPU**: Integrated or dedicated GPU for local video processing and WebGL acceleration
- **Browser**: Latest version of **Google Chrome**, **Microsoft Edge**, or **Mozilla Firefox** with support for:
- **WebAssembly**
- **WebGL**
- **MediaStream API** (for webcam access)
- **Internet Connection**: Stable connection required for real-time communication with the backend APIs and AI services
- **Permissions**:
- **Webcam access**: Required for gesture recognition and live interaction
- **Microphone access** *(optional)*: For future voice control features

> The Kivy Hub web app processes real-time video input locally to minimize latency and maximize responsiveness, making a capable hardware setup essential for smooth interaction.

For all components of the Kivy system, we prioritize cross-device compatibility, low resource consumption, and accessibility — ensuring that users can interact with our ecosystem seamlessly across platforms.
