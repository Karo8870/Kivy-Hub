# History

The Kivy project was originally launched under the name NutriCheck by a team of six members. While each team member contributed to the projectâ€™s initial development and direction, the full implementation of both the software and hardware components (meaning the Kivy Hub, Kivy App, Kivy Dev, Kivy Research, Kivy Website and design) was carried out by Cazacu Christian-Matei and Simedrea Alexandru.
