# Testing

Before preparing the final release version of our iOS nutrition app, we conducted a focused testing phase through TestFlight, Apple's official beta testing platform. Over the course of the testing window, 20 invited users from our target audience interacted with the application in real-world scenarios. These testers provided valuable feedback that helped us fine-tune the user interface, fix minor bugs, and validate the AI-powered nutrition and recipe recommendation features in everyday use.

The TestFlight build has since expired, and we have submitted the final version of the app for review. We are currently awaiting Apple’s approval to publish the app on the App Store, where it will be widely available to the public as part of the broader Kivy ecosystem.

To enforce code quality and reliability, we also configured commit hooks and merge hooks that automatically triggered tests and linting on every commit and pull request, ensuring that all changes met the required standards before being merged into the main branches.
