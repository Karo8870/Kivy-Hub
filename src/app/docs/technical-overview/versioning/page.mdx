# Versioning

Throughout the development of the Kivy project, we used **Git** for version control and **GitHub** for collaboration, issue tracking, and repository hosting. All of our source code is organized under the [Kivy-Infoeducatie GitHub organization](https://github.com/Kivy-Infoeducatie), which ensures structured collaboration and transparency across all modules of the project.

Our repositories are organized by purpose, each serving a dedicated role in the ecosystem:

- [`Kivy-Hub`](https://github.com/Kivy-Infoeducatie/Kivy-Hub): Contains the main **playground web app**, along with documentation and various utility pages related to Kivy.
- [`Kivy-Docs`](https://github.com/Kivy-Infoeducatie/Kivy-Docs): Central repository for **project documentation**, including PDF guides and an overview of the organizational structure.
- [`Kivy-CV`](https://github.com/Kivy-Infoeducatie/Kivy-CV): Handles all **computer vision tasks**, such as gesture recognition and camera input processing.
- [`Kivy-Research`](https://github.com/Kivy-Infoeducatie/Kivy-Research): Repository dedicated to the **research and experimental components** of the Kivy platform.
- [`Kivy-Backend`](https://github.com/Kivy-Infoeducatie/Kivy-Backend): Contains the **backend service**, APIs, and server logic that power the Kivy ecosystem.
- [`Kivy-Mobile`](https://github.com/Kivy-Infoeducatie/Kivy-Mobile): The **iOS mobile app** implementation of Kivy.
- [`Kivy-AI-API`](https://github.com/Kivy-Infoeducatie/Kivy-AI-API): Development repository for **AI services and APIs**, used internally by the Kivy ecosystem.

By using GitHub, we were able to track progress through issues and pull requests, collaborate effectively as a team, and maintain a clear history of changes throughout the project lifecycle. To enforce code quality and reliability, we also configured commit hooks and merge hooks that automatically triggered tests and linting on every commit and pull request, ensuring that all changes met the required standards before being merged into the main branches.
