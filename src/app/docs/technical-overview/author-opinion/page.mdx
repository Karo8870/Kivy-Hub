# Our Opinion on the Project Idea

We believe that the core idea behind the Kivy project—bringing together AI, nutrition science, and interactive technology—is both exciting and meaningful. From the very beginning, our goal was to create more than just a nutrition app. We wanted to design a complete ecosystem that helps people adopt healthier habits through intuitive, intelligent tools that fit naturally into their everyday lives.

What motivated us most was the potential to make nutrition guidance more accessible and engaging—whether through smart hardware in the kitchen or personalized AI recommendations on mobile. We see Kivy as a way to bridge the gap between science and daily practice in a way that’s actually useful for real people.

# Usefulness for the Target Audience

The demand for this product comes from those who want to monitor and analyze what they consume, as well as from nutritionists who need precise data about their patients, and also from chefs and people who enjoy cooking, discovering, and learning new recipes and culinary techniques.
