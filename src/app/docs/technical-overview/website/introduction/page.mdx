# Introduction

The Kivy website serves as the central platform for presenting the Kivy ecosystem of products and services, while also offering interactive tools and developer utilities. It includes a web usable version of Kivy Hub and a developer dashboard for the Kivy Dev API.

## Interactive Playground

The Interactive Playground allows users to simulate the Kivy Hub experience directly in their browser, without needing specialized hardware. It provides a virtual environment where hand gesture input can be tested through the device camera. This is achieved through a combination of computer vision and simulated touch input. The playground also includes sample recipes. It is intended for demo purposes and user onboarding.

## Documentation

This page provides general support resources for both end-users and developers. It includes setup guides for the Kivy Hub and App, troubleshooting tips, usage best practices, and answers to frequently asked questions.
