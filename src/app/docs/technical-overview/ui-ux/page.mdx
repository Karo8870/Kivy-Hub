## UI / UX

The application's interface was designed with a strong emphasis on simplicity, clarity, and accessibility, aiming to provide a pleasant and intuitive experience for users in our target audience. The modular design allows users to easily customize the dashboard based on their preferences and usage patterns, while the navigation remains fluid and responsive.

All visual elements follow a coherent and user-friendly design language, ensuring that functionality is easy to discover and understand. The user experience (UX) has been optimized for frequent use, minimizing the number of steps required to perform common actions. Clear visual feedback is provided for user interactions, enhancing both satisfaction and efficiency during use.

We focused on accessibility principles to ensure inclusivity and reduced cognitive load, especially for users who may interact with the platform regularly as part of their daily routine.

This design serves as a visual foundation for the implementation of the front-end components across the web, mobile, and interactive hub platforms within the Kivy ecosystem.
