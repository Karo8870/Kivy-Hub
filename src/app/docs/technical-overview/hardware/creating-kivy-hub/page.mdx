# Creating Kivy Hub

To create the first prototype of Kivy Hub, we went to a hardware store and bought three planks of wood (4.5 x 4.5 x 300 cm) that we cut into multiple smaller pieces as follows:

- Two 70 cm pieces for the base
- Two 125 cm pieces for the wall
- Three 50 cm to bridge between the wall and base pieces

Apart from these, we also took a 50 x 25 x 1 cm piece of wood to place the projector on.

Apart from the wooden structure, we also bought two sets of sliding bolts that fix the projector in place when standing up, L-shaped supports and screws.

After ensembling the wooden structure, we applied varnish to the wooden planks we cut. After everything dried, we screwed in the projector, positioned the camera and we were done.

For instructions on how to set up and use the hardware, refer to the [user manual](/docs/user-manual/kivy-hub/getting-started#setting-up).
