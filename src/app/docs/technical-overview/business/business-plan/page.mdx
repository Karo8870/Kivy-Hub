# Kivy

## I Overview

On 01.01.2025, the **Kivy** project was launched and began its actual activity.
**Kivy** is a smart product dedicated to the modern kitchen, combining an advanced nutritional application with an innovative physical device called **Kivy Hub**. It includes a projector and a camera that transforms any work surface into an interactive screen, controllable through gestures and voice commands.

The proposed solution centralizes essential functionalities, recipes, nutritional recommendations, AI assistant, timers, unit conversions, in an intuitive interface, to personalize the culinary experience. Thus, the application helps us control many nutritional aspects of our lives, such as what we should eat, how much water we should drink to find certain gaps.

**Kivy** is not just a digital assistant, but a smart cooking partner, adapted for both beginners and gastronomy enthusiasts, offering an interactive and efficient experience in the kitchen.

**Headquarters address:** Strada Calea București no. 75, Brașov.
**Form of organization:** Collective entrepreneur - team of students
**Main object of activity:** Manufacturing of computers and other electronic equipment

## II Executive summary

We see the conception of this project, respectively, product, as an opportunity in fact that we have identified a niche for the offered product, **Kivy**. Although there are and can apply nutritional applications that monitor physical activity, micronutrient consumption, can perform many such activities, sometimes they are found separate and do not communicate effectively with each other, requiring a lot of manual work to transfer data from one application to another, between various existing solutions.

The demand for this product comes from both those who want to monitor and analyze what they consume and nutritionists who want to see various data about their patients with precision, as well as chefs and people who like to cook, discover and learn new recipes and culinary methods.

The competitive advantage of what we are launching as a business results from the fact that all the searches made by team members in identifying nutritional, culinary and AI solutions similar to what we offer that are completely integrated into a harmonious system had the same result: there are no complete solutions, but only imperfect individual pieces and for the existence of similar software environments, and on the other hand similar for the adaptation environment, they are not special we also run into the same integration problem. **Our business vision** is: **"To become known on the market, by offering a quality product as a young team attracted by challenges and innovations"**.

In the same context, we present the following objective:

- Supplying all units ordered within a maximum of 7 working days;
- Improving health through proper nutrition;
- The demand will be created following the presentation of the facilities resulting from the following product: **Kivy Hub**.
- Presentation of the opportunity to use **Kivy Hub** will be demonstrated at the High School Fair, the Researchers' Night and demonstrations at various activities such as: Hackathon / Conferences / Presentations requested in order to popularize the product and attract potential investors.

### III.2 Commercial activity

It will be carried out through the application for services, subscriptions and software products, and for the hardware product through a website created specifically for the sale of the product.
The product is presented on the site and the services we offer and the shopping cart are highlighted.

The services we refer to consist of:

- Hardware component review

Virtual assistance

The company's activities will be carried out at the headquarters of the National College of Informatics
"Gr. Moisil" with headquarters at Calea București no. 75, Brașov.

### III.3 Production

The activity related to the actual production will initially be carried out at the college's headquarters, where the product will be assembled, after which, as the order for **Kivy Hub** increases, we are considering several spaces that we can call on without additional costs, for example: the parents' garage or the grandparents' barn. We will also focus on a space located in the city's commercial center, easily accessible to employees and customers. The price of such a space would be €350 per month. We have established partnerships for electronic components, the metal parts are produced by a company with which we have an agreement so that they can be made to order, in a short time without involving additional costs. Currently, the production and marketing areas are sufficient and optimal. We also emphasize the fact that the manufacture of the components used in the creation of our product, the transport and the use of the device can generate polluting emissions, which requires us to comply with the legislative norms in force and to carry out measurements that draw attention to the exceeding of the legal parameters admitted.

## IV Business Presentation

The activity of the team participating in the competition focuses on the production, development and marketing of **Kivy** , a system designed to help users achieve their nutritional goals, whether they want to lose weight, gain weight or maintain a healthy lifestyle. The application integrates a social network of culinary recipes and uses advanced technologies for monitoring progress, including intelligent algorithms and compatibility with wearable devices.

### IV.1 Technical and economic analyses

#### Materials used

**Kivy Hub** will be made up of an ergonomic structure, designed precisely for its applications, for the prototype version, it is created from a simple projector, attached by a rigid PLA plastic frame, a rigid and recyclable plastic to a wall. The robot runs wirelessly, a device where the processing components are located can be placed anywhere at a short distance, acting as a server. The orientation and positioning of the robot can be done manually, but the calibration is done automatically with high precision by means of a sensor installed on the front of the projector.

#### Infrastructure and Facilities

Our headquarters will include a main area where the assembly and testing of the product will take place. This area includes work tables and tools necessary for the activity. Being located within the school unit, the headquarters has all the necessary facilities to meet the needs of any kind of team members so that the activity can be carried out in the best conditions.

### IV.2 Sources of financing

The parts were purchased with personal funds, ensuring that we can create a fully functional prototype. With the growth of the company, we believe that we will be able to finance ourselves, both through the profit obtained and by the fact that by purchasing larger quantities of parts, the selling price can be negotiated in the sense of decreasing it.

### IV.3 Business size

We expect that in the next year we will be able to equip a considerable number of homes with the **Kivy Hub** product, as well as a medium-sized market coverage with the application. In an ideal case, we will achieve:

- In the first year, revenues of €22,500 (€150 / product unit)
- Profit: €5,000 (average total cost €100)
- Number of customers: 150 (for the hardware component) ~1,000 (for the software component)
- Geographic area (initially): Romania

### IV.4 Expansion

#### Perspective strategy

We thought about expanding the activity at the national level by analyzing an overview of the global market for nutritional applications, conducted in the USA. According to the latest research, their global market looks promising in the next 5 years. As of 2022, the global nutritional apps market was estimated at USD 1.1 billion and is expected to reach an even higher amount by 2028, with a CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) during the forecast years. This report covers a research period from 2018 to 2028 and presents an in-depth and comprehensive analysis of the global market.
