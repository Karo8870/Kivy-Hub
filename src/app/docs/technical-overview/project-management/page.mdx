# Project Management

The development of the Kivy project was driven by a structured and collaborative approach to project management. Our core team consisted of:

- **Cazacu Christian-Matei** — Web Developer, Backend Developer, Hardware Engineer, AI & Data Scientist
- **Simedrea Alexandru** — Web Developer, Mobile Developer, UI/UX Designer, and Tester

To manage tasks, timelines, and collaboration efficiently, we used Jira as our primary project management platform. Jira enabled us to maintain visibility across all aspects of development and ensure that every component — from frontend design to backend architecture and AI integration — progressed in a synchronized manner.

## Key Practices and Tools Used

### Agile Methodology:

We structured our work into well-defined sprints, enabling iterative development and continuous feedback integration.

### Backlog Management:

The product backlog helped us prioritize features, enhancements, and technical debt. This allowed us to adapt the roadmap based on both short-term goals and long-term vision.

### Issue Tracking:

We actively used Jira’s issue tracking system to log bugs, new feature requests, technical tasks, and documentation updates. Each issue was assigned a clear status (To Do, In Progress, In Review, Done), improving team accountability and transparency.

### Sprint Boards:

Visual sprint boards provided real-time overviews of team progress and bottlenecks, making daily stand-ups and sprint reviews efficient and focused.

### Labels and Epics:

Tasks were categorized using labels (e.g., `frontend`, `backend`, `cv`, `ai`, `docs`) and grouped into epics aligned with major features and milestones (e.g., Mobile App Release, AI API Integration, Hardware Interface, Documentation Delivery).

### Versioning and Releases:

Jira’s release tracking allowed us to map tasks to specific milestones, ensuring that each public version of the app was built on a stable, documented foundation.

By leveraging these tools and practices, we ensured a high level of coordination across disciplines, enabling the timely delivery of a complex, multi-platform product like Kivy.
