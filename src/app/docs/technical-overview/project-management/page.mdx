# Project Management

The development of the Kivy project was driven by a structured and collaborative approach to project management. Our core team consisted of:

- **Cazacu Christian-Matei** — Web Developer, Backend Developer, Hardware Engineer, AI & Data Scientist
- **Simedrea Alexandru** — Web Developer, Mobile Developer, UI/UX Designer, and Tester

To manage tasks, timelines, and collaboration efficiently, we used Trello as our primary project management platform. Trello enabled us to maintain visibility across all aspects of development and ensure that every component — from frontend design to backend architecture and AI integration — progressed in a synchronized manner.
