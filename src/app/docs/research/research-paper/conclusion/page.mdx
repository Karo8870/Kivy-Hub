# Conclusion

This paper presents Kivy, a unified AI-powered system that reimagines the kitchen as a context-aware, intelligent space for cooking and nutrition. Our proposed autoencoder architecture enables robust recipe understanding from text-only data, facilitating tasks like generation, retrieval, and dietary analysis. We believe Kivy lays the foundation for a new class of smart culinary systems, and we invite the scientific community to build upon our open data and architecture in future research.
