# Ethical Considerations

This project was developed with a strong emphasis on ethical responsibility and data integrity. All datasets used for training the AI models (namely Food.com, RecipeNLG, Open Food Facts, and USDA FoodData Central) are publicly available and licensed for research purposes. We ensured that no personal or sensitive user data was collected or used at any stage of development.

The recipe embedding model was designed to avoid bias by employing standardized preprocessing techniques and large, diverse datasets covering a wide range of cuisines, dietary needs, and cultural preferences. Nonetheless, we acknowledge the importance of continual evaluation to avoid reinforcing dietary stereotypes or excluding underrepresented food traditions.

The project aligns with the ethical standards for responsible AI development and the broader goals of using technology to improve health, education, and quality of life without compromising individual autonomy or dignity.
