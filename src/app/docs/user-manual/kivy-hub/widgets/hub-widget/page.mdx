# Hub Widget

The hub widget is the main menu of Kivy Hub. It allows users to navigate between screens, add widgets and many more. You can open the menu using a primary touch to reveal its options as white floating circles around it. You can press these options to trigger different actions or to further open more menus with multiple options. Usually, there will also be a back button on the hub itself allowing you to cancel or go back. The hub widget isn't movable.
