# Recipe Widget

The recipe widget is a static menu where you can visualize the current active recipe. It allows you to view the steps, the name, the description, duration, nutritional info, portion size, ingredients and more.

You can change the recipe by using the [recipe select tool](/docs/user-manual/kivy-hub/tools/recipe-select-tool).
