# Measure Tool

The measure tool is an overlay that covers the screen with a right triangle. It can be used to measure lengths, angles, arc lengths, check perpendicularity and more.

## Access

To access the measure tool, primary touch the [hub widget](/docs/user-manual/kivy-hub/widgets/hub-widget), then select the option with a ruler on it.

## Usage

After you open the tool, you will see that there are two targets you can move around. The triangle defined by these two points will show different metrics such as the distance between the targets, the angle the targets sit at, the middle point between them, lines parallel to the axis system going from a point to another and a circle with the origin in the first point ending at the second point.
