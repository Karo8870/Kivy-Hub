# Recipe Select Tool

For now, the recipe select tool is a quick way of changing the active recipe displayed by the recipe widget.

## Access

To access the recipe select tool, primary touch the [hub widget](/docs/user-manual/kivy-hub/widgets/hub-widget), then select the option with a book on it. This should open a secondary menu where you have to pick the recipe you want to use.

Currently, the recipes available in Kivy Hub are: Honey Garlic Chicken Thighs, Mediterranean Quinoa Salad, Creamy Tomato Basil Soup, Classic Margherita Pizza and Avocado Toast with Lemon (default).
