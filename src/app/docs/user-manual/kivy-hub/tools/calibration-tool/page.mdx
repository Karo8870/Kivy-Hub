# Calibration Tool

The calibration tool is an overlay that covers the whole screen with a white surface containing four qr-like (aruco) tags. It needs to be used whenever the camera, projector or structure are moved, re-positioned, re-aligned etc. This is also the only screen that moves the hub widget in the middle of the screen.

## Access

To access the calibration tool, first primary touch the [hub widget](/docs/user-manual/kivy-hub/widgets/hub-widget), then select the option with a gear on it. This should open the overlay. The calibration tool can also be accessed through a [global pose](/docs/user-manual/kivy-hub/interaction#global-poses) by holding your thumb forwards and have the rest of your fist closed.

## Usage

To use the calibration tool, you have to open it, and it will go back automatically when it is done with an appropriate message. If you wish to cancel the calibration process, either use the menu in the center and switch to home.
