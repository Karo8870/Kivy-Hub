# Grid Cutting Tool

The grid cutting tool is an overlay that covers the whole screen with a 2D rectangular grid. It can be used when you need to split a shape into multiple smaller rectangles of the same size, like a pie or a cake.

## Access

To access the grid cutting tool, first primary touch the [hub widget](/docs/user-manual/kivy-hub/widgets/hub-widget), then select the option with a knife on it. This should open a secondary menu where you have to pick the rectangle shape.

## Usage

After you open the tool, you will see that there are two targets you can move around. The rectangle defined by the centers of these two targets will determine how the grid will look. You can also see the length of the sides of the rectangle for precise measurements. When you're done measuring, primary touch the hub again to go back to home.
