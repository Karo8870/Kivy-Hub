# Ellipse Cutting Tool

The ellipse cutting tool is an overlay that covers the screen with an ellipse shape aligned to the axis. It can be used when you need to split a shape into slices like a pizza or a round cake.

## Access

To access the ellipse cutting tool, first primary touch the [hub widget](/docs/user-manual/kivy-hub/widgets/hub-widget), then select the option with a knife on it. This should open a secondary menu where you have to pick the circle shape.

## Usage

After you open the tool, you will see that there are two targets you can move around. The ellipse is projected to perfectly fit in the rectangle determined by these two targets. There are three radius lengths that split the ellipse into three equal radius parts starting from the center. There are also multiple lines going outwards starting from the center for cutting different numbers of slices, as follows:

| Color | Slice count |
| ----- | ----------- |
| Aqua  | 4           |
| Red   | 6           |
| Green | 8           |
