# Getting Started

This section provides a comprehensive guide to the initial setup of the Kivy Hub hardware. It covers all necessary steps to correctly install and configure the projector, camera, and processing unit to ensure optimal performance. Clear and detailed instructions will help you prepare the system for reliable, hands-free interaction with the projected interface. Proper setup is essential to maximize the accuracy and responsiveness of the device in your workspace. Please follow the guidelines carefully to facilitate a smooth installation process and immediate use.

## Kivy Hub structure

Kivy Hub is made out of two separate parts. One is called the **hub**. It is a plastic rectangular container that can be plugged in a power socket, that's where the brain of Kivy Hub is. The second part is called the **support**. It is a big L-shaped support structure that holds the projector and camera in place. It can also be folded for easier transport.

For future reference, we'll also define the different parts of the **support**.

1. The base - The bottom part of Kivy Hub, the one it sits on.

2. The wall - The lateral side of Kivy Hub, the thing the projector and camera sit on.

3. The bolts - Two metal sliding bolts that sit at the bottom side of the wall on the left and on the right. They are used to make sure the wall doesn't fall over.

## Setting Up

As long as you follow the steps, setting up Kivy Hub is easy

### 1. Plug in the hub

Go to a power outlet and plug the hub in. If it was set up correctly, it should emit green and red colors through its internal LED and after at most one minute it should start a green flickering light.

### 2. Open the support

Put the support on the ground and get a hold of the wall. Drag the wall upwards until it is perpendicular to the ground. When you're done, take the bolts and push them down until they go through both holes (the bolts should ho all the way) and then lock them by dragging them to the left or to the right.

> [!WARNING]
>
> Make sure whenever you move the wall, the bolts are raised up, under tension. Otherwise, the bolts, the wall, the holes of the bolts or the base might get damaged.

### 3. Power up the projector

Press the power button located on the top of the projector. The projection should start, and you should see a menu. Kivy can be used either wireless or through HDMI. While both versions work, we recommend using cable connection for a smoother experience. Connect the projector and the camera through your preferred way. For more information, please consult the [projector manual](https://manuals.plus/sinoy/hy320-smart-projector-manual).

### 4. Setting up the projection (optional)

Make sure that the placement of the projection isn't in a very bright room, and preferably at most 70 cm from the projection surface. If the surface is further away, you can adjust the focus using the wheel on the lens. You may also change the scale of the projection in the projector settings. If needed, you may also adjust the projection angle either manually or by using the settings. Please make sure that the camera is also correctly positioned.

### 5. Calibration

Once you have successfully opened Kivy Hub, open the calibration menu and run the algorithm. When it is done, test that there is a dot following the tip of your finger.

### All done!

You may now start using Kivy Hub. Please refer to the rest of the documentation on how to use the device. For a good understanding of how the device works, we recommend going through each page in the same order as the documentation. You can start with learning how to interact with Kivy Hub [here](/docs/user-manual/kivy-hub/interaction).
