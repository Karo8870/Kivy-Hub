# Widgets and Moving Widgets

Widgets are one of the core components of Kivy Hub. They are floating mini applications such as timers, the recipe view and even the [main hub](/docs/user-manual/kivy-hub/widgets/hub-widget) that you can usually move around and interact with. Basically, almost every thing on the Kivy Hub screen is a widget.

One of the most important things when using widgets is knowing how to move them around. To do so, you can follow some simple steps.

## 1. Making a secondary touch

Use your thumb and index finger to make a secondary touch. If you don't know what that is, check out the documentation on [how to interact with widgets](/docs/user-manual/kivy-hub/interaction#touches).

## 2. Moving

While hovering over the widget with a secondary touch, move the cursor slowly without exiting the area of the widget until you reach the target destination. When you're done, simply "release" the secondary touch by making a primary touch.
