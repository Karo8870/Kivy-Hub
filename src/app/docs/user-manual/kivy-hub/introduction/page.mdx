# Introduction to Kivy Hub

Imagine turning your kitchen counter or a classroom table into a smart, interactive workspace—no touchscreens, no buttons, just your hands and a clean surface.

The Kivy Hub is a powerful tool that projects an interactive interface directly onto any flat surface. You can browse recipes, set timers, cut virtual grids and much more—all with simple hand gestures in mid-air. It’s like having a digital assistant at your fingertips, without needing to touch a single thing.

Whether you’re cooking a meal, teaching a class or working on a creative project, the Kivy Hub adapts to your environment. It brings a new level of convenience and cleanliness to digital interaction—especially in places where touch isn’t practical.

This user manual will help you get the most out of your experience with the Kivy Hub. It’s structured to walk you through everything from setting up and using the hardware, to interacting with the projected screen, moving and controlling digital tools, and using the built-in widgets.
