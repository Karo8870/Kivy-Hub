# Recipe

When you open a recipe, multiple characteristics are shown about it. The properties of a recipe are grouped in four categories: Header, AI, comments and Steps.

The header shows general information, such as cooking time, difficulty, calories etc. You can also bookmark the recipe here to save it.
