# Calorie Intake

Calories can be managed within the Kivy App by accessing the Calorie Intake and Calorie Logging pages.

## Calorie Intake

Through the Calorie Intake page, we can see metrics about the calories consumed today, such as: consumed, active energy burned, net calories and remaining. We can also set a goal for calories and see today's logs (each calorie intake logged by the user). We can also see a 30-day history for calorie intake.

## Log Calories

As mentioned, we can log calorie intake using either the precision wheel which allows custom values or use one of the predefined buttons.
