# Kivy Documentation

Welcome to Kivy!

Kivy is a complex ecosystem made from a number of projects around cooking, nutrition and staying healthy.

The documentation is split into three parts, each for a type of users:

## Kivy for Users

This section is designed for everyday users who want to explore the Kivy platform to improve their cooking, nutrition and overall health. It includes guides on using the Kivy App, Kivy Hub hardware and software, generating personalized recipes, using features like the AI assistant and nutrition planner, navigating the site and much more. Whether you're a casual home cook or a health enthusiast, this is where youâ€™ll learn how to get the most out of Kivy.

See the [user manual](/docs/user-manual/introduction) for more details.

## Kivy for Developers

This section is for developers who want to build on top of the Kivy ecosystem. It covers API documentation, integration guides, Kivy Dev usage and API, as well as contributing to the Kivy embedded software. If you're looking to create your own apps, plugins or tools using Kivy's infrastructure or extend Kivy's existing products, start here.

## Kivy for Judges

This section provides an in-depth, behind-the-scenes look at the Kivy project, aimed at reviewers, evaluators and technical judges, but also people that want to learn more about how Kivy was built and how it works internally. It includes detailed documentation about the system architecture, AI models, research foundations, design decisions, development history and the overall vision. Perfect for contests, research fairs and innovation showcases where comprehensive technical insight is required.

See the [technical overview](/docs/technical-overview/introduction) for more details. Judges also take a look at [Kivy Research](/docs#kivy-research).

## Kivy Research

This section presents the scientific foundation behind the Kivy ecosystem. It includes the research paper that guided our development and the methodologies used. You'll find detailed descriptions of our architecture, dataset and more. This documentation is intended for judges, researchers and anyone interested in the theoretical and empirical work that supports Kivy's approach to nutrition.
