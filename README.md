Kivy is a smart kitchen assistant that helps you find recipes and cook them, as well as with random task around the kitchen. It is a wall-mounted device consisting of a projector and a camera that can transform nearly any surface into a hand interactive screen. Currently, it consists of a few tools, such as measuring tools, cutting tools, recipe selection tools and many more. Apart from the Kivy Software, Iâ€™ve also developed a culinary recipe autoencoder architecture that can transform a culinary recipe into a 512 number vector representation. I also trained the model on a dataset of almost 2.5 million recipes scrapped from different sources.
